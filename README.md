Syft JS
======

Front-side search/filter class for not-large datasets

2014, Brian Vaughn - @morningtoast

Inspired by PourOver but it was too complicated and more than I needed, so I made Syft to do only handle the few data points I needed. My data sets were also comparitively small, hundreds of records and not hundred-thousands.

Syft lets you do simple search/filter for strings and number ranges within a dataset.

This class is intended for single-page results views.
Syft just narrows data, it doesn't handle any display, templates or other rendering.

- Requires Underscore JS
- Works with jQuery but it is not a dependency

See syft.html source for an example
